      <h2>Five fun facts:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated in Austria in
          1683. It was created in honor of the Austrian victory over the Turks
          and modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some historians
          say the croissant originated in Hungary)
        </li>
        <li>
          August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing
          the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in
          Paris. (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to
          France...)
        </li>
        <li>The Croissant became the French national product in 1920.</li>
        <li>
          The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the
          nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good
          brioche).
        </li>
        <li>
          Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or
          shell, not to eat on its own.
        </li>
      </ul>
